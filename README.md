# ðŸ§  Dreamscribe MVP â€“ GraphRAG & Agentic AI (2024)

This repository showcases development work I completed for the MVP phase of **Dreamscribe**, an AI startup I collaborated with in 2024. The project focused on building an **Agentic AI architecture** backed by **Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)** â€” before these techniques became mainstream.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Contributions

- **Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG):**
  - Integrated **Neo4j** as a semantic + relational layer for context-aware retrieval.
  - Designed graph schemas to support dynamic and evolving knowledge representations.
  - Optimized retrieval using custom embedding strategies with Azure OpenAI embeddings.

- **Agentic AI Framework:**
  - Developed modular agent components for planning, memory management, and tool usage.
  - Implemented a token usage and cost tracking system using OpenAIâ€™s API, ensuring budget-aware execution.
  - Created task-specific agents for content summarization, sentiment filtering, and user intent modeling.

- **Full-Stack Integration:**
  - Integrated the backend with Azure cloud infrastructure and SQL databases.
  - Built APIs to interface with LLM agents and the graph database.
  - Participated in product design
